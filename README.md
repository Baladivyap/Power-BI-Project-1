Call Centre Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview

This project involved developing a Comprehensive Call Centre Analytics Dashboard in Power BI for a leading telecom company. The purpose was to offer the Call Centre Manager a clear, data-driven overview of call center operations to improve customer service and operational efficiency.

Problem Definition

The telecom company faced several challenges:

Difficulty identifying trends in call volume and customer issues.
Limited transparency in agent performance metrics.
Inefficiency in data handling due to scattered, unstructured data.
Limited insights into customer satisfaction and service quality trends.

Solution Approach

To address these issues, a systematic approach was followed, covering data preparation, modeling, and dashboard development.

1. Data Preparation and Modeling
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Raw call center data was cleaned and transformed into a star schema to enhance the data structure, making it more efficient for analysis. This schema organized data by key dimensions such as time, call type, and agent performance.
Data Modeling: Relationships between tables were established to support complex queries and comprehensive analysis.
2. Dashboard Development
Tool Selection: Power BI was chosen for its robust data visualization and interactive dashboard capabilities.
Design and Implementation: An interactive, user-friendly dashboard was designed with visualizations focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
Key Features:

Overall Calls Analysis

Visualizations tracking the number of calls answered, abandoned, and resolved to assess call handling efficiency.
Call Topics Categorization: Calls categorized by primary topics to identify recurring customer issues.
Monthly Call Volume Monitoring: Trend analysis visualizing monthly call volumes for insights into seasonal fluctuations and resource planning.
Customer Satisfaction Tracking: Customer satisfaction ratings tracked over time to monitor service quality.
Agent Performance Analysis: Quadrant chart to highlight top- and bottom-performing agents for targeted training and recognition.
Results and Impact
The dashboard led to significant improvements for the telecom company:

Enhanced Decision-Making

The Call Centre Manager gained an accurate, holistic view of call center performance.
Improved Efficiency: Recurring issues and performance trends were identified, leading to more focused training programs and resource allocation.
Increased Transparency: Key metrics were visually represented, making it easy for stakeholders to understand call center operations.
Continuous Improvement: Insights from the dashboard supported ongoing performance assessment and strategic planning.
